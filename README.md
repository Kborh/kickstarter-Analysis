# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

  kickstarter is one of the popular and self-funding platforms that exist, and is use by creators of projects to seek funding from their supporters.
	Despite its popularity, not all projects that hit the ground on kickstarter would succeed. This could be for variety of reasons, and this is what we intend to 
	investigate. With this dataset, we can learn what makes a kickstarter project succeed, failed or canceled. Hopefully, our analysis can aid individuals who want to 
	contribute to the world through kickstarter. Taking projects from the past and analyzing the data, the answer could help us inform the future.

### Purpose
	This analysis is intended to explore and uncover trends of the kickstarter projects by examining the funding procedure; which, depending on how it conducted, can   lead to
	failed and or success of the kickstarter campign project.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	According to our chart analysis, the most common time to launch a project on kickstarter is between May and June. Past that point, the gap between successful and   unsuccessful narrows down 
	until the month of Decemer, when the lines interset and the failed count surpasses successful for the first time. what this means is that we need to look at         information such as the percent funded for the higghest
	and lowest success count and sewe if we can see significant correlations. Even when we filter the last month of the year by category no industry shows a trend of   in the month December. 
	
	

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	Whether a project will succeed of failed is contigent on the targeted goal amount, the number of backers, main or parent category
	of the project, and duration of the campaign, with the goal amount and backers being the strongest predator.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  
  From my analysis of the dataset, the setting of releastic taget and deadline was some of the challenges presented. Some of Kickstarter tergat were unobtainable     because it was too high. Setting the right tergat and time to achieve them is paramount. Another challange was building interest. Kickstarter extablished its       campaign before they tried to generate interest from consumers. Interest has to be extablish about three months in advance before launching your campaign. this     will   help you get an initial large boost of your goals.
	

## Results
	
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  The following conclusion can be drawn based on my analysis of the dataset:
  
  1. That the highest number of projects belong to entertainment genre particularly to theatre, music, and film & video category.
  
  2. That The theater category attracts the most number of project, while music category attracts the second highest number of projects. However, success to failure      ratio is high for music category than theatre category.
  
  3. In theatre category, the highest number of projects belong to "plays" sub-category. However, their are unsuccessful projects in this sub category of theatre.
  
  4. The second highest number of projects belong to "rock" sub-category in music category and the projects have had 100% success rate.  
  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	The success of project depends on the project goals. The bigger the project, the less likely will it get founded. For larger projects, it's harder to get 
	enough momentum to raise money. There are also correlations between the project(creator) and the outcome. The more projects that is created, the higher the         likelihood
	for successful projects. The strongest correlation was probably between the category of the project and the success rate. For instance, theater projects, are the   most successful.
	My assumption is, they are rather small and hit a certain fan base. On the other hand, plays are not successful, though they might also be small. My guess is       that, it is more 
	difficult to established fan base. We could further look into what differs theater from plays projects, by analyzing mean size for successful and fail projects.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	
	The size of the dataset is not large enough for all categories and subcategories, so some of the results are not statistically relevant given the sample size. We   need to further 
	figure out how statistically relavent these results are by analyzing variety of kickstarter dataset to draw more significant insights.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	We could filter a pivot table by (1) using the duration of conversion,(2) the date created conversion, and (3) the date ended conversion.
	maybe there is a trend to see what separate the duration of success and failed project. Also, a graph for all the metrics pulacovered with and without play(the     most popular catagory), can be constructed.
